# Mini Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of over 100 mini Python projects that I have developed for practicing and improving my Python skills. These projects are designed in increasing order of difficulty, starting from easy ones and gradually progressing towards more challenging ones.

The purpose of this README file is to serve as documentation for all these projects without explicitly mentioning their names. Instead, it will provide an overview of the different areas I have explored during my Python learning journey.

## Skills Acquired

Throughout these exercises, I have gained proficiency in the following areas:

1. **Automation**: I have learned how to automate various tasks using Python.
2. **Game Development**: I have dabbled in creating simple games using Python.
3. **Application Development**: I have built small applications using Python.
4. **Web Development**: I have gained knowledge in web development using Python.
5. **Data Science**: I have explored the field of data science and machine learning using Python.
6. **Professional Python Programming**: I have acquired skills for professional-level Python programming.

## Libraries and Frameworks

During my learning journey, I have become familiar with the following Python libraries and frameworks:

- **Selenium**: A library used for automating web browsers.
- **Beautiful Soup**: A library for web scraping and parsing HTML and XML documents.
- **Requests**: A library for making HTTP requests.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building web applications.
- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: A library for scientific computing with Python.
- **Scikit-learn**: A library for machine learning and data mining.
- **Plotly**: A library for interactive data visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: A library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

Please note that this list is not exhaustive, but it provides an overview of the main tools and frameworks I have worked with.
